## Submission

This is an initial submission of MetaComp -- a set of routines enabling a visual comparison 
of multi-project metagenomic taxonomy assignments. While MetaComp is a part of EDGE Bioinformatics
platform, the code can be used as a stand-alone library for multi-project visualization of 
taxonomy assignments obtained with GOTTCHA, BWA, KRAKEN, and METAPHLAN.
